## Project Content

### Iot

- Arduino with Hardware Security Module and GPS Sensor
- should post signed data into 3Box Thread (doestn work)

### Contract

- Solidity Smart Contracts, deployed on Goerli Testnet
- Contains basic features, but no DAO actually (missing time)
- handles Challenge Submissions and Voting as well as Token distribution

### Mobile App

- Ionic WebApp which allows to test the features and becoming addicted, when the MVP is released ;-)

### Conclusion

- 16hours not enough to hack the super solution
- Idea is promising
- 3box dapp needs refactoring -> very hard to start with that

### Team

- Frank (Dapp, Solidity)
- Robert (Iot)
- Moritz (Presentation, DApp Design)
- Christoph (Solidity)
- Sebastian (Dapp)
